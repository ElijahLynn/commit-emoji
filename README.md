============

List of emoji for git commits. :boom:


Interesting idea from the Atom.io [contributing docs](http://atom.io/docs/v0.62.0/contributing).

> Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji

List of Emojis for commits:

#####* :lipstick: when improving the format/structure of the code
#####* :racehorse: when improving performance
#####* :non-potable_water: when plugging memory leaks
#####* :memo: when writing docs
#####* :bulb: New Idea

Example:

> ":lipstick: fixing coding standard."

> ":racehorse: 2s improvement on xyz."


Have other ideas for commit emojis ? (bug fix, new feature, idk?)

Personally I really like this idea since it makes it really easy to see the goal of the commit.

Putting this here since I plan on doing this and I'll like to have a place to point my team to.
